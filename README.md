# Hello there!

> Simple Contact List Flutter Client

I created this simple app to be used in conjunction with the Java server side application 'simple-contact-list'.
Both projects are just demos, as all other projects are private for commercial reasons.

You can find the Java Rest API app at https://github.com/MichelFortes/simple-contact-list
